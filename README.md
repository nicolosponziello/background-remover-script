# background-remover-script
bash script to remove background from images

This script uses ImageMagick libraries to convert images.

## How to use
To use this script, create a folder "src" where to put all the original images. __Note that this works only if the source images are in .png format!"

Then create an "out" folder where the converted images will be located.
The script will take all the images in src folder, convert them and put into out folder.

Simply run the script and enjoy!
